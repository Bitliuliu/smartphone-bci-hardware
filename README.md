## About

This project was born with the idea of designing a workshop for participants to build their own 2 electrode EEG reader and connect it to a phone at EMF camp 2016 for around £20.

The first draft of what we aimed to have was:

* On a budget 2 electrode EEG system
* An SSVEP operated brain computer interface (BCI) where the user can select emojis or letters from a virtual keyboard on a smartphone.

## Hardware

The current revision of the Board is v0.1. The current verdsion of the files generating the board is 4.

Instructions on how to produce the final PCB from the information can be obtained from the following sources:

* [adafruit smd pcb tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/smt-manufacturing)
* [sparkfun tutorial on solder paste](https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/58)


## Software

See [SMARTPHONE-BCI](https://github.com/capitancambio/smartphone-bci) for a description of the software used in EMF.
